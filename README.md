My CS50 Project

A dynamic movie-quiz website to help fellow late night movie watcher find their next watch without spending hours on search. The idea is to find the best movie for the night without directly asking obvious questions.

Such questions could be about similar movies based on actors and writers (which most people wouldn't remember), asking about the composer, playing snippets of the soundtrack, maybe a funny quote from each movie, and so on. 

As of now, the development goal is to deploy a version 0.1 which only outlines the basic functionality of the website, api, and so on, including some basic dynamically updated questions. 

Each commit includes a description of the stuff done since the last commmit (not extensive details), and a brief idea of what is next.
