### My Personal Project for Harvard's CS50 Course
still a work in progress.
### Idea
My First Personal Project, still a work in progress. 
- I have often found myself spending hours and hours looking for the best movies of the night, sometimes between multiple movies, and ending up losing time and energy in this way
- The idea of this website is aid you in choosing a movie based on questions and assessments about a given 2 movies that you want to decide between, the entire philosopy is to 
understand which movie will work out best for you, without actually asking you this dreadful question.
- I started this in Late 2023, but got carried away by life and now school, so I could not complete it, but I plan to finish it now before december.
- The December version will only be a preliminary version. Simple preloaded questions based on what info I can gather about the two movies. 

## Versions
### V0.1 Log:
Version 0.1 is officially complete.
Movienight has the basic functionality to compare two movies based one simple questions with pre-coded and dynamic answers.
The files themselves are messy, inefficient, and probably won't scale well to smaller devices.
However, for now, it is good enough.

Future versions will include:
- Better efficienty by reducing API calls and image sizes
- More questions to better understand the user.
- Better optimized Scoring functions
- More modularity in HTML design.
- Better Responsiveness in HTML design.
- Animations and transitions for winner.html and fight.html
- Better files organisations and removal of inline CSS.
- Standardizes button classes and forms.
- The use of AJAX efficiency in JS.
- Better use of Flask and Jinja2 (Reducing load on server)
- Consistent use of sessionstorage and flasksession.
- Server level database for movies, and additionaly API calls
- User accounts and history (database).
- User feedback and comments.
- General movie fights averages. (database)
- An About me page and a donation page.
- Apis that connect to streaming servers to see movie availability.
- A better search function for movies that filters unrecognized movies (includes a 'Show more button')

That's all for now.
