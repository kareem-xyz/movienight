My First Personal Project, still a work in progress. 
- I have often found myself spending hours and hours looking for the best movies of the night, sometimes between multiple movies, and ending up losing time and energy in this way
- The idea of this website is aid you in choosing a movie based on questions and assessments about a given 2 movies that you want to decide between, the entire philosopy is to 
understand which movie will work out best for you, without actually asking you this dreadful question.
- I started this in Late 2023, but got carried away by life and now school, so I could not complete it, but I plan to finish it now before december.
- The December version will only be a preliminary version. Simple preloaded questions based on what info I can gather about the two movies. Future version could include stuff like
  opinion of multiple users, a random movie reccomendation wheel, a browsing page, and so on. But before that, the initial version needs to be finalised with modular function and
  consistent flow.
